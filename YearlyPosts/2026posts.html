        <h2 class="topics">My Dad bought a shitty phone</h2>
        <small> Date: 05-02-26</small>
        <p>My Dad bought a cheap iphone knockoff for only 7,200 rupees. Even though the phone is for my mom and she doesn't need a powehouse of a phone, I still can't help but cringe at the fact that its a blatant rip-off and overall a shit phone.</p>
        <pre>
        Here is the specs:
        RAM and ROM:    6GB and 128GB
        Front camera:   8MP
        Back camera:    20MP
        Battery:        5000mAh
        CPU:            (I don't even know, but its shitty and it gets hot easily)
        </pre>
        <p>The only good thing I can think is that it came with a free headphone, it's 5G and it has a micro sd slot. The speaker is worse than my father's current phone, you can't even video call with it and most of the pre-installed apps (except google-apps) are all ancient apps that I remember from back when I was in class 3.</p>

        <h2 class="topics">I joined a quiz competition</h2>
        <small> Date: 24-01-26</small>
        <p>I still can't believe it... but I won the competition!</p>
        <p>So you see there was a quiz competition happening at Navodaya vidyalaya Kakching, Manipur and I was asked to joined the competition. Even though I wanted to decline it so bad, the teachers were looking at me with such anticipation and expectation that I failed to do so properly (I said I did not want to do it).</p>
        <p>So I looked at the bright side and thought "I am going to have a new experience!". The teacher said it was going to be a team competition So, I decided to shift my responsibility to others which I am not proud of but she was kind and smart. I want to be somewhat more responsible next time.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the day of the competition came and I thought I was the most unprepared out of the three students from our school but the competition turned out to be a MCQ and So, I gambled and... I somehow won the first prize! LIKE BRO WHAT!? I admit I knew about 60% of the questions but some where pure guess (Also the quiz was a inter-school competition). I didn't know how to feel about this I felt very undeserving of this and also I thought of huge expectation the teachers would place on me now.</p>
        <p>But I won I guess and the prize was 1500 rupees. Also the quiz was just a part of a program to raise awareness of operation sindoor.</p>

        <h2 class="topics">Practical exam</h2>
        <small> Date: 10-01-26</small>
        <p>So, we finally did the practical exam... and it was a lot more fun than I thought it would be.</p>
        <p>You see because we did the practical classes so late, we had to cram all the necessary ones in a short amount of time and it was a lot of fun even though I think I am somewhat bad at it.</p>
        <p>But during the course of the practical classes only three students were regular for boys (for girls it was 7-8). And becausse of that many student's were confused on what to write on the practical notebook. Some of my classmates submitted the practical notebooks during the exams.</p>
        <p>As for the practical exam itself... it was a complete joke. We didn't even do any practical tasks (for our school), we just copied the answers from the practical notebook and that's it.</p>
