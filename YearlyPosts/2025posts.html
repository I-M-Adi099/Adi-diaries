        <small> Date: 20-12-2025</small>
        <p>We went to Andro and Khongjom, and I was very excited to see the cherry blossom but it was so dissapointing, The cherry were so little and scarce that it didn't look pretty at all and there were only two or three of those trees. On our way, we started music in the loud speaker and at first it was very fun but it got annoying after some time. I didn't get to explore Kangla because I was tired. Overall it was a fun experience and I will remember it foe life.</p>

        <small> Date: 12-12-2025</small>
        <p>So I have been having some problems in my leg because of health issue for some time but the day before yesterday my wisdom teeth got swollen and it hurt like hell. So I am constantly in pain because of this and also I cannot eat properly. But after that I then got fever O.O are you kidding me, like, what did I do to deserve all this.</p>
        <p>After that I went to the hospital and found out that I had thiamine defeciency and I think I know what caused this. You see since I've had my leg problems before and since the symptoms were similar I just assumed that my liver was damaged, and I didn't eat any meat at all and over time my appetite also decreased, but it turns out that my liver was completely fine and I was restraining myself for no reason. So, that's why you need a doctor's guidance and you shouldn't treat any serious and uncommon illness on your own.</p>
        <p>Also I couldn't believe my eyes when the doctor just pulled out chatGPT to analys my test result. Like, didn't you study this your whole life? Why are you asking AI.</p>
        <p>Oh! and you see when I started this school(HKMES) I asked the principal if I could take alternative english since I am weak in Manipuri and he said yes, and so for almost the entire year I did alternative english but when the HSLC exam got near the council rejected my form because I took MIL in class X and now they want us to pay the fine(which is 2,000 rupees) and also we tried to issue my OBC certificate but it got rejected. Why am I getting so many rejection for something like official documents? WHY?</p>

        <p>I am currently studying in class 11 and the year is about to end but we still havn't done any practical classes. We are the first batch for this school and honestly I like it here but there are a lot of... "negligence" cause like the year is about to end but WE STILL HAVN'T DONE ANY PRACTICAL CLASS WHY???? Also why is science stream so expensive like first we have to buy the theory bookss but after that we have to buy the practical textbooks okay but after that what do you mean we have to buy the aprons shouldn't the school provide that?</p>
