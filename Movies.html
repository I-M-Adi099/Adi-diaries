        <img src="images/movies poster/shutter island.jpg" alt="Shutter Island">
        <p>This movie is a masterpiece of a psychology film. This film will make you feel like a mentally sick person and question yourself if any of the characters can be trusted with amazing acting, direction, cinematography.</p>

        <img src="images/movies poster/Gangs of wasseypur.jpg" alt="Gangs of Wasseypur">
        <p>Note: I am refering to both of the movies.<br> This movie is my favourite movie that has come out of bollywood.</p>
        <p>This is also the first bollywood movie that I watched that has no filter, like it doesn't shy away from swearing, naughty, awkward, weird, and violent scene while also being incredibly real. So it was a lot more memorable. I don't think there will be another movie like this ever.</p>
        <p>What I loved the most about this film is the vibe. The characters really feel like the biggest piece of shit that are actually real peaple with layers of complexity, ambition, method, etc. while its cinematography and direction feel like a cinema (not all the time).</p>

        <img src="images/movies poster/hera pheri.jpg" alt="Hera Feri">
        <p>Best comedy film ever with the most iconic characters.</p>
        <p>I don't think I need to say a lot for this movie. I watched this to have fun and I have never laughed harder watching a film beside this one.</p>

        <h2 class="topics">Kill</h2>
        <img src="images/movies poster/kill.jpg" alt="Kill">
        <p>My favourite action film of all time. I love how this movie slowly keeps building tension throughout the whole film and when it finally reached its climate OH BOY IT WAS SO TUFF!! I love this film.</p>

        <h2 class="topics">12 Angry Men</h2>
        <img src="images/movies poster/12 angry men.jpg" alt="12 Angry Men">
        <p>Just absolute cinema. The majority (like 99%) of the film take place in a room and all they do is talk, and somehow I couldn't keep my attention away from this movie at all. This film will really make you think and question you judgment, and throughout this film it will develop most of the characters.</p>

        <h2 class="topics">Kung fu Panda (1-3)</h2>
        <img src="images/movies poster/Kung fu panda.jpg" alt="Kung fu Panda">
        <p>legendary trilogy of all time (I hate part 4).</p>
        <p>It is funny, inspiring, cool, and sad, with part two being my favorite movie of them all.</p>
        <p>But what I love the most about this franchise are the villains (except for the chameleon). They are cool, scary and sometimes funny and very memorable.</p>

        <h2 class="topics">The wild robot</h2>
        <img src="images/movies poster/The wild robot.jpg" alt="The wild robot">
        <p>This film made me laugh, cry, proud and a lot of other things that I loved about old disney and pixar films. I didn't know I could still cry with watching talking animals but I absolutely loved this movie</p>
    </div>

    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">Spiderman franchise</h2>
        <img src="images/movies poster/spiderman.jpg" alt="Spiderman">
        <p>I don't think I need to say anything about this franchise. It was, and still is, my favorite superhero of all time.</p>
        <p>Even though a lot of people don't like the MCU spiderman as much. I still like it as much as other. My favorite version of spiderman is the Tobey Maguire, followed by spider-verse, for the last two I love them equally.</p>

        <img src="images/movies poster/barfi.jpg" alt="barfi">
        <p>I had heard a lot of good things about this film and I wanted to watch something a little light hearted, also I was becoming a fan of Ranbir Kapoor's acting. So, it was the perfect film.</p>
        <p>I absolutely LOVED this film. I loved the characters, the story, the music, the comedy, the mystery, and everything there is not a single flaw in this film what so ever. I was invested from beginning to end, it is cute, wholesome, sad, funny and a little annoying (not in a bad way, atleast for me).</p>

        <h2 class="topics">Planet of the apes franchise</h2>
        <img src="images/movies poster/Planet of the apes.jpg" alt="Planet of the apes">
        <p>Ceasar (The main ape) is the coolest mf to ever exist.</p>
        <p>For the first film (Rise of the planet of the apes) I thought it was going to be a stupid film but I was actually invested in the story. I actually liked a lot of the characters and I cheered for the apes to be free.</p>
        <p>The dawn of the planet of apes is my favorite movie out of the whole franchise, the mood a become a lot darker and I liked the slow tension between the humans and the apes, and the climax is the greatest of all time. Ceasar became even more cool and well written.</p>
        <p>The war of the planet of apes movie really tested ceasar, and even though I was not interested in some parts of the film (maybe I was not paying attention). I absolutely loved the climax and how the villain was handled or concluded</p>
        <p>The kingdom of the planet of apes was a nice change of pace, it takes place 2000? or 200? so (I don't remember) after the first three films. And it is more of an adventure, and the new hero is also very likable sort of like an underdog who dosn't realise his potential, and the main villain is the highlight of the film for me, his personality is a lot different from all the other villains before and overall a great villain.</p>
