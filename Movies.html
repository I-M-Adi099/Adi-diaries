        <p>This movie is a masterpiece of a psychology film. This film will make you feel like a mentally sick person.</p>

        <p>This movie has done irrepairable damage to me and I wished I never watched this film. Now although this film has left a bad taste in my mouth I have to admit this is an excellent film for its execution. This film has one of the most impressive one-take fighting scene and it is very entertainingly quirky but its plot twist is the highlight of this movie. I know I shouldn't be mad at this since that was the whole point but I'm was a 15 year old at the time so I was disgusted and it gave me a feeling I've never felt before. Love it or hate it, but there is one thing all of us who have seen this film will agree upon and that is we will never forget this film</p>

        <p>My favourite action film of all time. I love how this movie slowly keeps building tension throughout the whole film and when it finally reached its climate OH BOY IT WAS SO TUFF!! I love this film.</p>
