        <h2 class="topics">Chainsaw Man</h2>
        <img src="images/anime poster/chainsaw man.jpg" alt="Chainsaw Man">
        <p>Chainsaw Man is my no. 1 favourite anime/manga. It was also one of my first manga and I thankfully went in blind. Some people judge it by the fanservice but the series is much deeper than that. It's about loss, family, purpose, and identity. Brilliant characters, crazy action, amazing story.</p>

    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">Attack on Titan</h2>
        <img src="images/anime poster/aot.jpg" alt="Attack on Titan">
        <p>I couldn't watch it earlier because I was broke, but once I finally watched it, it lived up to the hype. Great lore, characters, and one of the best stories ever. Season 4 took it to another level. Some minor nitpicks about the ending, but overall it's a classic.</p>

    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">One Piece</h2>
        <img src="images/anime poster/one piece.jpg" alt="One Piece">
        <p>I regret sleeping on One Piece. Although, the beginning part of the anime was average with a little charm at best it kept getting better and better. Skypiea is where it hooked me — the lore, worldbuilding, and character dynamics are insane. I haven't completed it yet, but it's already in my top 3.</p>

    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">Vinland Saga</h2>
        <img src="images/anime poster/vinland saga.jpg" alt="Vinland Saga">
        <p>“I have no enemies.” This moment defines the series. Incredible character development and powerful themes. Nearly every major character is written with depth. A fantastic story overall.</p>

    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">Mob Psycho 100</h2>
        <img src="images/anime poster/mob psycho.jpg" alt="Mob Psycho 100">
        <p>Mob is overpowered but doesn't let that define him. He focuses on improving himself in other ways. Motivational show, great characters, 3 seasons of clean animation, and a perfect ending.</p>

    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">Death Note</h2>
        <img src="images/anime poster/death note.jpg" alt="Death Note">
        <p>This was one of my early anime I watched and oh boy I had never seen anything like this, since it was my first thriller-suspence media, and I fell in love wiht this anime. The plot was so interesting, the characters were so smart and charming. It is one of the GOAT of anime</p>

        <img src="images/anime poster/Jojo.jpg" alt="Jojo's Bizarre Adventure">
        <p>This is one of the most unique or should I say bizzare anime I've seen in my life. One of the greatest power system, lovable casts and </p>

        <h2 class="topics">A silent voice</h2>
        <img src="images/anime poster/a silent voice.jpg" alt="A Silent Voice">
        <p>This is a very beautiful movie about redemption and forgiveness. I really like the journey of the main character and it is also very inspiring.</p>

        <h2 class="topics">Perfect Blue</h2>
        <img src="images/anime poster/perfect blue.jpg" alt="perfect blue">
        <p>Mind bending anime. This will make you question what is real and what is fake with great suspense and mystery.</p>

        <img src="images/anime poster/takopi's original sin.jpg" alt="Takopi's Original Sin">
        <p>What the fuck. This is one hell of a rollercoaster ride. This will make you experience all kinds of emotion and overall very heartbreaking and heartfelt anime.</p>
