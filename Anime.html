    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">Chainsaw Man</h2>
        <p>Chainsaw Man is my no. 1 favourite anime/manga. It was also one of my first manga and I thankfully went in blind. Some people judge it by the fanservice but the series is much deeper than that. It's about loss, family, purpose, and identity. Brilliant characters, crazy action, amazing story.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">Attack on Titan</h2>
        <p>I couldn't watch it earlier because I was broke, but once I finally watched it, it lived up to the hype. Great lore, characters, and one of the best stories ever. Season 4 took it to another level. Some minor nitpicks about the ending, but overall it's a classic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">One Piece</h2>
        <p>I regret sleeping on One Piece. Skypiea is where it hooked me — the lore, worldbuilding, and character dynamics are insane. I haven't completed it yet, but it's already in my top 3.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">Vinland Saga</h2>
        <p>“I have no enemies.” This moment defines the series. Incredible character development and powerful themes. Nearly every major character is written with depth. A fantastic story overall.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="boxes">
        <h2 class="topics">Mob Psycho 100</h2>
        <p>Mob is overpowered but doesn't let that define him. He focuses on improving himself in other ways. Motivational show, great characters, 3 seasons of clean animation, and a perfect ending.</p>
