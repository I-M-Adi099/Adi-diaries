        <p>I am currently studying in class 11 and the year is about to end but we still havn't done any practical classes. We are the first batch for this school and honestly I like it here but there are a lot of... "negligence" cause like the year is about to end but WE STILL HAVN'T DONE ANY PRACTICAL CLASS WHY???? Also why is science stream so expensive like first we have to buy the theory bookss but after that we have to buy the practical textbooks okay but after that what do you mean we have to buy the aprons shouldn't the school provide that?</p>
