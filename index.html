        <small> Date: 24-01-26</small>
        <p>I still can't believe it... but I won the competitionf!</p>
        <p>So you see there was a quiz competition happening at Navodaya vidyalaya Kakching, Manipur and I was asked to joined the competition. Even though I wanted to decline it so bad, the teachers were looking at me with such anticipation and expectation that I failed to do so properly(I said I did not want to do it). So I looked at the bright side and thouht I am going to have a new experience but dreaded at the thought of oral competition(I am socially awkward and my voice is not clear), but thankfully the teacher said it was going to be a team competition So I could shift my responsibility to others and I did which I am not proud of but she was kind and smart. I want to be somewhat responsible next time.</p>
        <p> So the day of the competition came and I thought I was the most unprepared out of the three students from our school but the competition turned out to be a MCQ and So I gambled and I somehow won the first prize like bro what I admit I knew about 60% of the questions but some where pure guess(Also the quiz was a inter-school competition). I didn't know how to feel about this I felt very undeserving of this and also I thought of huge expectation the teachers would place on me now. But I won I guess and the prize was 1500 rupees. Also the quiz was just a part of a program to raise awareness of operation sindoor.</p>

        <small> Date: 20-12-2025</small>
        <p>We went to Andro and Khongjom, and I was very excited to see the cherry blossom but it was so dissapointing, The cherry were so little and scarce that it didn't look pretty at all and there were only two or three of those trees. On our way, we started music in the loud speaker and at first it was very fun but it got annoying after some time. I didn't get to explore Kangla because I was tired. Overall it was a fun experience and I will remember it foe life.</p>

        <h2 class="topics">I think GOD is ragebaiting me</h2>
        <small> Date: 12-12-2025</small>
        <p>So I have been having some problems in my leg because of health issue for some time but the day before yesterday my wisdom teeth got swollen and it hurt like hell. So I am constantly in pain because of this and also I cannot eat properly. But after that I then got fever O.O are you kidding me, like, what did I do to deserve all this.</p>
        <p>After that I went to the hospital and found out that I had thiamine defeciency and I think I know what caused this. You see since I've had my leg problems before and since the symptoms were similar I just assumed that my liver was damaged, and I didn't eat any meat at all and over time my appetite also decreased, but it turns out that my liver was completely fine and I was restraining myself for no reason. So, that's why you need a doctor's guidance and you shouldn't treat any serious and uncommon illness on your own.</p>
        <p>Also I couldn't believe my eyes when the doctor just pulled out chatGPT to analys my test result. Like, didn't you study this your whole life? Why are you asking AI.</p>
        <p>Oh! and you see when I started this school(HKMES) I asked the principal if I could take alternative english since I am weak in Manipuri and he said yes, and so for almost the entire year I did alternative english but when the HSLC exam got near the council rejected my form because I took MIL in class X and now they want us to pay the fine(which is 2,000 rupees) and also we tried to issue my OBC certificate but it got rejected. Why am I getting so many rejection for something like official documents? WHY?</p>

        <small> Date: 05-12-2025</small>
        <p>I am currently studying in class 11 and the year is about to end but we still havn't done any practical classes. We are the first batch for this school and honestly I like it here but there are a lot of... "negligence" cause like the year is about to end but WE STILL HAVN'T DONE ANY PRACTICAL CLASS WHY???? Also why is science stream so expensive like first we have to buy the theory bookss but after that we have to buy the practical textbooks okay but after that what do you mean we have to buy the aprons shouldn't the school provide that?</p>
