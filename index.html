        <small> Date: 24-01-26</small>
        <p>I still can't believe it... but I won the competitionf!</p>
        <p>So you see there was a quiz competition happening at Navodaya vidyalaya Kakching, Manipur and I was asked to joined the competition. Even though I wanted to decline it so bad, the teachers were looking at me with such anticipation and expectation that I failed to do so properly(I said I did not want to do it). So I looked at the bright side and thouht I am going to have a new experience but dreaded at the thought of oral competition(I am socially awkward and my voice is not clear), but thankfully the teacher said it was going to be a team competition So I could shift my responsibility to others and I did which I am not proud of but she was kind and smart. I want to be somewhat responsible next time.</p>
        <p> So the day of the competition came and I thought I was the most unprepared out of the three students from our school but the competition turned out to be a MCQ and So I gambled and I somehow won the first prize like bro what I admit I knew about 60% of the questions but some where pure guess(Also the quiz was a inter-school competition). I didn't know how to feel about this I felt very undeserving of this and also I thought of huge expectation the teachers would place on me now. But I won I guess and the prize was 1500 rupees. Also the quiz was just a part of a program to raise awareness of operation sindoor.</p>
